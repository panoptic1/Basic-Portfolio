        <p>I am a Full-Stack Developer with deep roots in the Twin Cities, and plenty of experience living in a variety of other geographies from the West Coast to the Middle East. I've had a lifelong appreciation of grammatical structure and theories of grammar (nerd alert!), which inevitably led me to pursue a career in coding.</p>
        <p>In addition to writing code, I am a writer of poetry, prose, and essays, which informed my previous career as a secondary educator in cities across the country and beyond.</p>
        <p>When I'm not hammering out sections of code, stanzas of poems, or paragraphs of prose, there's a good chance you'll find me on my cycle, in the kitchen, or wrangling a toddler.</p>
